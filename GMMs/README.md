# Gaussian Mixture Models for scorring ligand binding assays

This part of the repo contains the data, scripts, and results for implimenting GMMs for the clustering and scoring of ligand binding PK assays.  All scripts exist additionaly as Jupyter notebooks with results visualized.

If one wishes to replicate the experiments using GMMs, a Conda enviornment is provided and can be used by the comand:
```bash
conda env create -f GMMs.yml
```
Scripts can then be run in Python once Conda has been downloaded and the GMM enviornment has been created.
